 * Description: This file contains the type definitions necessary to
 *              implement a work order data type.  A work order
 *              describes the fleet number, manufacturer, model,
 *              and problem description for a particular bus or 
 *              train in the tri-met fleet that requires maintenance
 *              or repair.
 *
 * NOTE: CS303 Students SHOULD NOT modify this file.  At the time of grading,
 *       this file will be overwritten with the original file provided.  Any
 *       modifications made to this file will not be considered in the
 *       grading process.

  char * description;   // A description of the problem.
